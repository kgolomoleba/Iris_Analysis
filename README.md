# Data Analysis and Visualization with Pandas and Matplotlib

## Overview
This project performs basic data analysis and visualization on the Iris dataset using Python libraries pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

## Contents
- **data_analysis_iris.py** (or `.ipynb` notebook): Python script/notebook containing code to:
  - Load and explore the Iris dataset
  - Perform basic data analysis (statistics and grouping)
  - Create four types of visualizations (line chart, bar chart, histogram, scatter plot)
  - Present findings and observations from the data

## Libraries Used
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Instructions
1. Run the Python script or notebook in an environment with the required libraries installed.
2. The script will output data summaries, charts, and observations to the console and display windows.

## Findings Summary
- The Iris dataset is clean with no missing values.
- There are distinct differences in measurements between the three species.
- Visualizations show trends and relationships, such as the positive correlation between sepal length and petal length.
- The bar chart and scatter plot clearly differentiate species characteristics.
